# Habit Tracker Project Rules

## Code Standards

1. **TypeScript Required**: Use TypeScript (`.ts`/`.tsx`) for all new files. No plain JavaScript.

2. **Small, Focused Components**: Each component should do one thing well.
   - Keep components under 100 lines when possible
   - Extract logic into custom hooks
   - Extract utilities into `/utils`

3. **Type Safety**: Define explicit interfaces in `/types`. Use `import type` for type-only imports.

4. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Components: `PascalCase.tsx`
   - Hooks: `useCamelCase.ts`
   - Utilities: `camelCase.ts`
   - Types: `PascalCase` interfaces

## Architecture

5. **State Management**: All app state flows through `useHabits` hook. Components receive state via props.

6. **Persistence**: localStorage only. No backend services.

7. **Styling**: Simple CSS in `App.css`. No CSS frameworks.

## Scope & Planning

8. **MVP Scope**: Respect the scope defined in `@.cursor/plans/habit-tracker-mvp.md`.
   - Check "Must-Haves" before adding features
   - New features belong in "Nice-to-Haves (V2+)" unless explicitly approved
   - "Out of Scope" items are not to be implemented

9. **Planning Guidelines**: Follow `@anti-pitfall-guidelines` when updating or creating plans:
   - MVP First: Core functionality before extras
   - Dependency Awareness: Sequence tasks clearly
   - Iterative Milestones: Independently valuable chunks
   - Avoid Over-Engineering: Happy path first
   - Clear Scope: Must-haves vs nice-to-haves

## Before Making Changes

- [ ] Is this within MVP scope?
- [ ] Does it follow the dependency order in the plan?
- [ ] Is it the simplest solution that works?
- [ ] Are types properly defined?
- [ ] Is the component focused and small?
